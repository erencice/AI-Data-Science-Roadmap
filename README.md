- 🧪 Practice: Complete a capstone project demonstrating: problem framing, data pipeline, modeling with uncertainty quantification, model interpretation, rigorous evaluation, and stakeholder communication.
- ✅ Pass: Deliver a fully reproducible project (single command to run); include README documenting problem, approach, assumptions, limitations, and risks; provide model interpretation (SHAP/PDP); write a 1-page non-technical summary for stakeholders.
- 🛠️ How: Use Git for version control; Docker for reproducibility; include uncertainty estimates (bootstrap CIs or Bayesian); create visualizations for non-technical audience; document all decisions.

- Keep work in any format; seed randomness for reproducibility.
- Use Flex Weeks to finish pass items, review tricky parts, and add spaced-repetition cards (optional).

**Important Limitation Regarding Theoretical Econometrics**

This roadmap includes foundational econometric resources (Gujarati for Basic Econometrics, Lütkepohl for Time Series, Cunningham for Causal Inference) that provide essential intuition and practical implementation skills. However, **these resources have limited theoretical rigor and depth compared to advanced theoretical econometrics textbooks** such as:
- Greene's *Econometric Analysis*
- Hayashi's *Econometrics*  
- Hansen's *Econometrics*
- Hamilton's *Time Series Analysis*
- Wooldridge's graduate texts

The included materials **do not cover** advanced topics with mathematical rigor:
- Asymptotic theory (consistency, asymptotic normality, delta method)
- Formal proofs of estimator properties
- Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) with complete derivations
- Maximum likelihood theory and proofs
- Rigorous treatment of weak instruments, specification tests, and identification
- Advanced time series theory (unit root asymptotics, cointegration proofs)

**If your goal is theoretical mastery of econometrics** (e.g., PhD-level econometrics, original methodological research, or formal proofs), you should supplement this roadmap with the advanced theoretical texts listed above or pursue a dedicated econometrics curriculum. The current roadmap emphasizes **applied intuition and practical implementation** over formal mathematical rigor in econometric theory.

# üöÄ AI & Data Science Roadmap

Welcome to the **AI & Data Science Roadmap**!

This guide offers a structured, step-by-step learning path designed to build your knowledge progressively. You'll start from foundational mathematics and statistics, move through programming and data manipulation, and then advance toward sophisticated machine learning, deep learning, and production-level AI systems.

Each section is divided into numbered steps (1., 2., 3., etc.) to indicate a recommended hierarchical learning order.

Additionally, within each step, you'll find "**Resource Priority**" tables. These tables denote the importance level of each resource (e.g., **Must-have**, **Nice-to-have**).

Every section includes carefully selected resources such as courses, books, articles, and practical projects to ensure both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience.

Follow this roadmap to learn effectively, connect concepts across disciplines, and develop real-world skills that will empower your journey in AI, data science, and beyond.

Let's dive in! üìòüìäü§ñ
